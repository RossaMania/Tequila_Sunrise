            The modern drink originates from Sausalito, California, in the early
            1970s after an earlier one created in the 1930s in Phoenix, Arizona.
            The cocktail is named for its appearance when served—with shadings
            of colors resembling a sunrise.

            The original Tequila Sunrise was created by Gene Sulit in the 1930s
            or 1940s.and contained tequila, creme de cassis, lime juice, and
            soda water. It was served at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel.

            The more popular modern version of the cocktail contains tequila,
            orange juice, and grenadine, and was created by Bobby Lozoff and
            Billy Rice in the early 1970s while working as young bartenders at
            the Trident in Sausalito, California. At the time, the Trident was
            the largest outlet for tequila in the United States.

            In 1972, there was a private party at the Trident to kick off the
            Rolling Stones' American tour. Lead singer Mick Jagger had one of
            the cocktails, liked it, and he and his entourage started drinking
            them. The Stones later ordered them all across America, even dubbing
            the tour itself their "cocaine and tequila sunrise tour".

            To make a Tequila Sunrise cocktail, you just need tequila, orange
            juice, and grenadine syrup. Tequila can be found in a liquor store.
            Grenadine syrup can be found in a grocery store as a mixer. The
            mixers are usually by the soda or soft drinks. Not many liquor
            stores carry mixers. Orange juice can be found in a grocery store,
            gas station, or market.

            Grab a clean <code>glass,</code> and put it on a counter, or table.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Add <code>ice</code> in the glass.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Pour the <code>tequila</code> straight from the bottle into the
            glass. Count to three. One. Two. Three. Stop pouring.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Pour <code>orange juice</code> from its container into the glass.
            You can pour as much orange juice as you want.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Pour the <code>grenadine syrup</code> from the bottle into the
            glass. Count to two. One. Two. Stop pouring. If a three-count or
            four-count is done while pouring the grenadine syrup, the cocktail
            will become too sweet, and the sunset effect will be lost.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Take a couple of breaths, and let the grenadine syrup float to the
            bottom. The colors in the glass should start looking like a sunset.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Do not stir nor shake the glass.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Be sure to put the tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup back
            in the refrigerator.

            A tequila sunrise is usually served in a high ball glass to really
            show off those gorgeous colors. It can be garnished with half orange
            slice, an orange zest, or any other fruit like a cherry. A straw is
            optional, just be sure not to accidentally stir the drink. Remember,
            it just won't lose that sunset effect. It will taste really sweet.
