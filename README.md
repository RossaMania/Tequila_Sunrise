# Tequila Sunrise

This is a step-by-step guide on how to make a Tequila Sunrise. This guide also includes remixes with different liquors and mixers.

This site includes three media queries. One for desktop, one for tablets, and one for mobile devices. The pictures on this website were added with a "mobile first mindset". This means I added the pictures using Flexbox--a row for desktop, and a row for mobile.

There is also a fun facts section at the bottom of the page!
